django-sql2orm
==============

I want a way to reverse engineer a SQL query to get a candidate ORM call. This may not be possible.

**NOTE**
I don't know if this is even possible or extraordinarily difficult. But there are times when I'd like
to know *exactly* where a particular SQL query may have been executed from. This project serves as
an experiment
